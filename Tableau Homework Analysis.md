# Tableau Homework - Citi Bike Analytics

## City Official Map

I know an observation isn't necessary for the [City Official Map](https://public.tableau.com/profile/briana.friendt#!/vizhome/CityOfficialMap_15963336127400/CityOfficialMap?publish=yes), but it's interesting that the two most popular stations for are the same for starting and ending trips - Grove ST Path and Hamilton Park.

## Phenomena 1 - 2019 User Composition by Trip

From the charts for my [first phenomena](https://public.tableau.com/profile/briana.friendt#!/vizhome/2019UserComposition/UserComposition), you can see that there is a much higher number of trips taken by subscribers than short term customers. In addition, males make up the high majority of users. However, more short term customers listed their gender as unknown (18,285) than male (16,543) last year. 

Clearly, male user get the most use out of the program between average distance, average duration and number of trips taken. Male short term customers travel the farthest on average. While subscribers make a lot of trips, they are a short duration; short term customers take longer trips on average. 

After reviewing the data and the plan options, I would suggest adding more membership options besides the annual plan, maybe a 6-month plan or classify the plans based on the amount of use (casual and frequent). Safety and attire could be a reason that the female user population is so low, so additional lights and a quicker process for procuring the bike and being on your way could be ways to increase that user market.

## Phenomena 2 - 2019 Highest Volumes

For my [second phenomena](https://public.tableau.com/profile/briana.friendt#!/vizhome/2019HighVolumes/2019HighVolumes), I wanted to visualize the highest volume days and times and include information in regards to user type. The busiest times and days of the week are commute days and times - Monday through Friday around 8 AM and 6 PM. Subcribers get the most use of the bikes during the weekdays for their commute while short term customers get the most use out of the bikes on the weekends.
